            <h2>Distraction & Entertainment</h2>
            <p>We make hospital visits more fun and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>Simple medical procedures, such as getting blood drawn or vaccination, can be very stressful and anxiety-provoking for a child. In these situations, playing a simple game in virtual reality can distract the child, help them relax and even
                reduce the pain. This is not just beneficial for the child, but also the parents, doctors and nurses, who are often very busy.</p>
            <p>Hospital stays does not have to be boring.</p>
            <p>Virtual reality is a great way to escape from the real world and take your mind off of things. VR games functions as entertainment for those unfortunate kids who are hospitalized for a longer period of time. There are games for children of
                all ages and the VR games are all designed to be relaxing, positive and happy. They can go to the zoo, play minigolf, explore space or even go for a walk in the park with their virtual puppy, which they can feed, pet and teach tricks.</p>

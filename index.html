    <h2>Distraction & Entertainment</h2>
      <p>We make hospital visits more fun and enjoyable.</p>
      <p>Simple medical procedures, such as getting blood drawn or vaccination, can be very stressful and anxiety-provoking for a child. In these situations, playing a simple game in virtual reality can distract the child, help them relax and even reduce the pain. This is not just beneficial for the child, but also the parents, doctors and nurses, who are often very busy.</p>
